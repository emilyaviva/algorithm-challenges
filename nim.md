# Nim

## Rules
Nim is a two-player game. The players start with a certain number of stones. On your turn, you may take away 1, 2, or 3 stones. You may not pass a turn. Players alternate turns until there are exactly 0 stones remaining. The player who removes the final stone is the winner.

## Challenges
1. Your opponent is a robot who always picks a random number of stones. Find and implement an algorithm to play the game perfectly against the robot.

2. The rule changes so that the player who removes the final stone _loses_ (this is often called "misère Nim"). Re-implement your algorithm.

3. You may now take away 1, 3, or 4 stones, but not 2.

4. Misère Nim with (3).

5. At the start of the game, all the stones are divided into three heaps. A player may take _any_ number of stones from any single heap; the player who removes the last stone is the winner.

6. The stones are divided into a random number of heaps.

7. Misère Nim with (5) and (6).
